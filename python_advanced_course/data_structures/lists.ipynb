For example, objects in a parking lot - these can be cars, motorcycles, etc. It will be convenient to combine these elements into a list and perform the necessary actions on them, for example, check whether a parking space is occupied or not. It is natural to assume that the number of parking spaces may change over time, it may be empty in the morning and full in the evening. Such a data structure as a list will easily help to implement adding / deleting / accessing by index to describe objects in the parking lot."
