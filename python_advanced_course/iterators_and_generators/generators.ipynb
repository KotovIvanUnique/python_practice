    "In Python, a generator can be called a language construct that is a function using the yield keyword inside, or a generator expression. Inside the generator, the __iter__() and __next__() methods are defined, from this point of view, in Python, any generator is an iterator. The difference lies in the fact that iterators are the iteration of the elements of the collection, and the generator is the creation, processing and return for further processing of the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the function range(start, stop, step) is a generator that creates a sequence of numbers with a certain step. At any given time, the developer only knows the current element, since only that element is stored in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python2, the range() function creates all the elements at once and returns them for iteration, that is, it is not a generator, but the xrange() function is already a generator and an analogue of the range() function from Python3."
