    "Unfortunately, in Python and its standard CPython interpreter, threads only appear to run in parallel, but they actually run sequentially. This is due to the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), which limits Python to one running thread per unit of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous module on the garbage collector, it was described that Python has a system for counting object references. The problem that the GIL solves is the ability for different threads to increment or decrement object references at the same time. It can happen that one thread dereferences an object and Python deletes it, while another thread uses the newly deleted object, resulting in an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, this problem can be solved by adding locks to each object, but, unfortunately, this can lead to the problem of deadlocks - this is when threads are waiting for resources that another thread has captured, and so on endlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "GIL is a lock on the Python interpreter itself. This is the only lock in Python that solves the problem of deadlocks, but in turn makes all applications single-threaded."

    "If we divide all programs into CPU-dependent (image processing, matrix multiplication) and I / O-dependent (network communication, accessing the database), then we can understand that the use of threads and the GIL does not carry anything critical in I / O operations , because the time taken by Python to switch threads will be offset by the I/O time. At the same time, it is natural that, regardless of the number of processor cores, any multi-threaded Python program will not be able to unlock its potential and will work even slower than a single-threaded program due to switching GIL between threads.\n",
