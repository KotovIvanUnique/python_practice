    "Encapsulation, along with inheritance and polymorphism, is one of the three pillars of OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation can be properly considered from two points of view:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is the association of data with the methods that this data uses.\n",
    "2. It is the control of access to data and the methods that this data uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The explanation of encapsulation as a relationship is simple - it can be any class in which attributes exist and there are methods that these attributes use. After all, no one forbids creating a class without user methods and a class with methods, but without user variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, usually encapsulation is meant as access control to methods and data. Access in this case is the ability to see/change class attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three levels of data access in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- public - available to everyone;\n",
    "- private - available only inside the class;\n",
    "- protected - available inside the class and inside classes of heirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The public level is the default level, no special constructs need to be used to make an attribute or method public. See an example of the Auto class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make an attribute or method protected, you need to add a single _ before the name:"
