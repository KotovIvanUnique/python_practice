    "Polymorphism in code provides loose coupling and, because of this, it can be easily extended and maintained. On the other hand, you need to be careful when designing classes. When creating polymorphic classes, inheriting one from the other, functions should be correctly redefined, for example, adding new variables to a function can lead to an error, because these variables are not passed to the base class method."
